   *
   * By default, this component creates a new CloudFront distribution. But you might

   *
   * - A path like `/docs`
   * - A subdomain like `docs.example.com`
   * - Or a combined pattern like `dev.example.com/docs`
   *
   * @example
   *
   * To serve your static site **from a path**, you'll need to configure the root domain

   *     path: "/docs"
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * If you are using a static site generator make sure the base path is set in your
   * config.
   *
   * :::caution
   * If routing to a path, you need to configure that as the base path in your
   * static site generator as well.
   * :::
   *
   * For Vite, set the `base` option in your `vite.config.ts`. It should end with
   * a `/` to ensure asset paths like CSS and JS, are constructed correctly.
   *
   * ```js title="vite.config.ts" {2}
   * export default defineConfig({
   *   base: "/docs/"
   * });
   * ```
   *
   * To serve your static site **from a subdomain**, you'll need to configure the
   * domain in your `Router` component to match both the root and the subdomain.
   *
   * ```ts title="sst.config.ts" {3,4}
   * const router = new sst.aws.Router("Router", {
   *   domain: {
   *     name: "example.com",
   *     aliases: ["*.example.com"]
   *   }
   * });
   * ```
   *
   * Now set the `domain` in the `router` prop.
   *
   * ```ts {4}
   * {
   *   router: {
   *     instance: router,
   *     domain: "docs.example.com"
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * Finally, to serve your static site **from a combined pattern** like
   * `dev.example.com/docs`, you'll need to configure the domain in your `Router` to
   * match the subdomain.
   *
   * ```ts title="sst.config.ts" {3,4}

/**
 * The `StaticSite` component lets you deploy a static website to AWS. It uses [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) to store your files and [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) to serve them.
 *
 * It can also `build` your site by running your static site generator, like [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) and uploading the build output to S3.
 *
 * @example
 *
 * #### Minimal example
 *
 * Simply uploads the current directory as a static site.
 *
 * ```js title="sst.config.ts"
 * new sst.aws.StaticSite("MyWeb");
 * ```
 *
 * #### Change the path
 *
 * Change the `path` that should be uploaded.
 *
 * ```js title="sst.config.ts"
 * new sst.aws.StaticSite("MyWeb", {
 *   path: "path/to/site"
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * #### Running locally
 *
 * In `sst dev`, we don't deploy your site to AWS because we assume you are running it locally.
 *
 * :::note
 * Your static site will not be deployed when run locally with `sst dev`.
 * :::
 *
 * For example, for a Vite site, you can run it locally with.
 *
 * ```bash
 * sst dev vite dev
 * ```
 *
 * This will start the Vite dev server and pass in any environment variables that you've set in your config. But it will not deploy your site to AWS.
 *
 * #### Deploy a Vite SPA
 *
 * Use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) to deploy a React/Vue/Svelte/etc. SPA by specifying the `build` config.
 *
 * ```js title="sst.config.ts"
 * new sst.aws.StaticSite("MyWeb", {
 *   build: {
 *     command: "npm run build",
 *     output: "dist"
 *   }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * #### Deploy a Jekyll site
 *
 * Use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to deploy a static site.
 *
 * ```js title="sst.config.ts"
 * new sst.aws.StaticSite("MyWeb", {
 *   errorPage: "/404.html",
 *   build: {
 *     command: "bundle exec jekyll build",
 *     output: "_site"
 *   }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * #### Deploy a Gatsby site
 *
 * Use [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) to deploy a static site.
 *
 * ```js title="sst.config.ts"
 * new sst.aws.StaticSite("MyWeb", {
 *   errorPage: "/404.html",
 *   build: {
 *     command: "npm run build",
 *     output: "public"
 *   }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * #### Deploy an Angular SPA
 *
 * Use [Angular](https://angular.dev) to deploy a SPA.
 *
 * ```js title="sst.config.ts"
 * new sst.aws.StaticSite("MyWeb", {
 *   build: {
 *     command: "ng build --output-path dist",
 *     output: "dist"
 *   }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * #### Add a custom domain
 *
 * Set a custom domain for your site.
 *
 * ```js {2} title="sst.config.ts"
 * new sst.aws.StaticSite("MyWeb", {
 *   domain: "my-app.com"
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * #### Redirect www to apex domain
 *
 * Redirect `www.my-app.com` to `my-app.com`.
 *
 * ```js {4} title="sst.config.ts"
 * new sst.aws.StaticSite("MyWeb", {
 *   domain: {
 *     name: "my-app.com",
 *     redirects: ["www.my-app.com"]
 *   }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * #### Set environment variables
 *
 * Set `environment` variables for the build process of your static site. These will be used locally and on deploy.
 *
 * :::tip
 * For Vite, the types for the environment variables are also generated. This can be configured through the `vite` prop.
 * :::
 *
 * For some static site generators like Vite, [environment variables](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode) prefixed with `VITE_` can be accessed in the browser.
 *
 * ```ts {5-7} title="sst.config.ts"
 * const bucket = new sst.aws.Bucket("MyBucket");
 *
 * new sst.aws.StaticSite("MyWeb", {
 *   environment: {
 *     BUCKET_NAME: bucket.name,
 *     // Accessible in the browser
 *     VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY: "pk_test_123"
 *   },
 *   build: {
 *     command: "npm run build",
 *     output: "dist"
 *   }
 * });
