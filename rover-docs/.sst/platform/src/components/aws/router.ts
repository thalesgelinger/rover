   * The _key_ is the route path and the _value_ can be:

   * - The destination URL as a string
   * - Or, an object with
   *   - Args for a URL route
   *   - Args for a bucket route
   *
   * :::note
   * All routes need to start with `/`.
   * :::
   *

   * ```ts
   * {
   *   routes: {
   *     "/*": "https://example.com"
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   *

   * ```ts
   * {
   *   routes: {
   *     "/files/*": {
   *       bucket: myBucket
   *     }
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * When router receives a request, the requested path is compared with path patterns
   * in the order they are listed. The first match determines which URL the
   * request is routed to.
   *
   * :::tip[Default Route]
   * The `/*` route is a default or catch-all route.
   * :::
   *
   * The `/*` route is a _default_ route, meaning that if no routes match, the `/*` route will be used. It does not matter where the `/*` route is listed in the routes object.
   *
   * :::note
   * If you don't have a `/*` route, you'll get a 404 error for any requests that don't match a route.
   * :::
   *
   * Suppose you have the following three routes.
   *
   * ```js
   * {
   *   routes: {
   *     "/api/*.json": "https://example1.com",
   *     "/api/*": "https://example2.com",
   *     "/*.xml": "https://example3.com",
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * A request to `/api/sample.xml` will match `/api/*` first and route to it; even though it matches `/*.xml`.
   *
   * However for this case, a request to `/api/users` will route to `/api/*` even though it comes after `/*`. This is because the `/*` route is the default route.
   *
   * ```js
   * {
   *   routes: {
   *     "/*": "myapp.com",
   *     "/api/*": myFunction.url
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * You can also customize the route behavior with injecting some code into the CloudFront
   * Functions. To do so, pass in an object, with the destination as the `url`.
   *
   * ```ts
   * {
   *   routes: {
   *     "/*": {
   *       url: "https://example.com",
   *       edge: {
   *         viewerRequest: {
   *           injection: `event.request.headers["x-foo"] = { value: "bar" };`
   *         }
   *       }
   *     }
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * You can also `rewrite` the request path.
   *
   * ```ts
   * {
   *   routes: {
   *     "/files/*": {
   *       bucket: myBucket,

/**
 * The `Router` component lets you use a CloudFront distribution to direct
 * requests to various parts of your application like:
 *
 * - A URL
 * - A function
 * - A frontend
 * - An S3 bucket
 *
 * @example
 *
 * #### Minimal example
 *
 * ```ts title="sst.config.ts"
 * new sst.aws.Router("MyRouter");
 * ```
 *
 * #### Add a custom domain
 *
 * ```ts {2} title="sst.config.ts"
 * new sst.aws.Router("MyRouter", {
 *   domain: "myapp.com"
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * #### Sharing the router across stages
 *
 * ```ts title="sst.config.ts"
 * const router = $app.stage === "production"
 *   ? new sst.aws.Router("MyRouter", {
 *       domain: {
 *         name: "example.com",
 *         aliases: ["*.example.com"]
 *       }
 *     })
 *   : sst.aws.Router.get("MyRouter", "E1XWRGCYGTFB7Z");
 * ```
 *
 * #### Route to a URL
 *
 * ```ts title="sst.config.ts" {3}
 * const router = new sst.aws.Router("MyRouter");
 *
 * router.route("/", "https://some-external-service.com");
 * ```
 *
 * #### Route to an S3 bucket
 *
 * ```ts title="sst.config.ts" {2,6}
 * const myBucket = new sst.aws.Bucket("MyBucket", {
 *   access: "cloudfront"
 * });
 *
 * const router = new sst.aws.Router("MyRouter");
 * router.routeBucket("/files", myBucket);
 * ```
 *
 * You need to allow CloudFront to access the bucket by setting the `access` prop
 * on the bucket.
 *
 * #### Route to a function
 *
 * ```ts title="sst.config.ts" {8-11}
 * const router = new sst.aws.Router("MyRouter", {
 *   domain: "example.com"
 * });
 *
 * const myFunction = new sst.aws.Function("MyFunction", {
 *   handler: "src/api.handler",
 *   url: {
 *     router: {
 *       instance: router,
 *       path: "/api"
 *     }
 *   }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Setting the route through the function, instead of `router.route()` makes
 * it so that `myFunction.url` gives you the URL based on the Router domain.
 *
 * #### Route to a frontend
 *
 * ```ts title="sst.config.ts" {4-6}
 * const router = new sst.aws.Router("MyRouter");
 *
 * const mySite = new sst.aws.Nextjs("MyWeb", {
 *   router: {
 *     instance: router
 *   }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Setting the route through the site, instead of `router.route()` makes
 * it so that `mySite.url` gives you the URL based on the Router domain.
 *
 * #### Route to a frontend on a path
 *
 * ```ts title="sst.config.ts" {4-7}
 * const router = new sst.aws.Router("MyRouter");
 *
 * new sst.aws.Nextjs("MyWeb", {
 *   router: {
 *     instance: router,
 *     path: "/docs"
 *   }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * If you are routing to a path, you'll need to configure the base path in your
 * frontend app as well. [Learn more](/docs/component/aws/nextjs/#router).
 *
 * #### Route to a frontend on a subdomain
 *
 * ```ts title="sst.config.ts" {4,9-12}
 * const router = new sst.aws.Router("MyRouter", {
 *   domain: {
 *     name: "example.com",
 *     aliases: ["*.example.com"]
 *   }
 * });
 *
 * new sst.aws.Nextjs("MyWeb", {
 *   router: {
 *     instance: router,
 *     domain: "docs.example.com"
 *   }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * We configure `*.example.com` as an alias so that we can route to a subdomain.
 *
 * #### How it works
 *
 * This uses a CloudFront KeyValueStore to store the routing data and a CloudFront
 * function to route the request. As routes are added, the store is updated.
 *
 * So when a request comes in, it does a lookup in the store and dynamically sets
 * the origin based on the routing data. For frontends, that have their server
 * functions deployed to multiple `regions`, it routes to the closest region based
 * on the user's location.
 *
 * You might notice a _placeholder.sst.dev_ behavior in CloudFront. This is not
 * used and is only there because CloudFront requires a default behavior.
 *
 * #### Limits
 *
 * There are some limits on this setup but it's managed by SST.
 *
 * - The CloudFront function can be a maximum of 10KB in size. But because all
 *   the route data is stored in the KeyValueStore, the function can be kept small.
 * - Each value in the KeyValueStore needs to be less than 1KB. This component
 *   splits the routes into multiple values to keep it under the limit.
 * - The KeyValueStore can be a maximum of 5MB. This is fairly large. But to
 *   handle sites that have a lot of files, only top-level assets get individual
 *   entries.
