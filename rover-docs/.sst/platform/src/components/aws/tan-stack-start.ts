 * #### Minimal example
 *
 * Deploy a TanStack Start app that's in the project root.
 *
 * ```js title="sst.config.ts"
 * new sst.aws.TanStackStart("MyWeb");
 * ```
 *
 * #### Change the path
 *
 * Deploys the TanStack Start app in the `my-app/` directory.
 *
 * ```js {2} title="sst.config.ts"
 * new sst.aws.TanStackStart("MyWeb", {
 *   path: "my-app/"

 * #### Add a custom domain

 *
 * ```js {2} title="sst.config.ts"
 * new sst.aws.TanStackStart("MyWeb", {
 *   domain: "my-app.com"
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * #### Redirect www to apex domain
 *
 * Redirect `www.my-app.com` to `my-app.com`.
 *
 * ```js {4} title="sst.config.ts"
 * new sst.aws.TanStackStart("MyWeb", {
 *   domain: {
 *     name: "my-app.com",
 *     redirects: ["www.my-app.com"]
 *   }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * #### Link resources
 *
 * [Link resources](/docs/linking/) to your TanStack Start app. This will grant permissions
 * to the resources and allow you to access it in your app.
 *
 * ```ts {4} title="sst.config.ts"
 * const bucket = new sst.aws.Bucket("MyBucket");
 *
 * new sst.aws.TanStackStart("MyWeb", {
 *   link: [bucket]
 * });

 *
 * You can use the [SDK](/docs/reference/sdk/) to access the linked resources
 * in your TanStack Start app.
