   *
   * ##### Python
   *
   * For Python, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is used to package the function.
   * You need to have it installed.
   *
   * :::note
   * You need uv installed for Python functions.
   * :::
   *
   * The functions need to be in a [uv workspace](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/workspaces/#workspace-sources).
   *
   * ```js
   * {
   *   handler: "functions/src/functions/api.handler"
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * The project structure might look something like this. Where there is a
   * `pyproject.toml` file in the root and the `functions/` directory is a uv
   * workspace with its own `pyproject.toml`.
   *
   * ```txt
   * ├── sst.config.ts
   * ├── pyproject.toml
   * └── functions
   *     ├── pyproject.toml
   *     └── src
   *         └── functions
   *             ├── __init__.py
   *             └── api.py
   * ```
   *
   * To make sure that the right runtime is used in `sst dev`, make sure to set the
   * version of Python in your `pyproject.toml` to match the runtime you are using.
   *
   * ```toml title="functions/pyproject.toml"
   * requires-python = "==3.11.*"
   * ```
   *
   * You can refer to [this example of deploying a Python function](/docs/examples/#aws-lambda-python).
   *
   * ##### Golang
   *
   * For Golang the handler looks like.
   *
   * ```js
   * {
   *   handler: "packages/functions/go/some_module"
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * Where `packages/functions/go/some_module` is the path to the Go module. This
   * includes the name of the module in your `go.mod`. So in this case your `go.mod`
   * might be in `packages/functions/go` and `some_module` is the name of the
   * module.
   *
   * You can refer to [this example of deploying a Go function](/docs/examples/#aws-lambda-go).
   *
   * ##### Rust
   *
   * For Rust, the handler looks like.
   *
   * ```js
   * {
   *   handler: "crates/api"
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * Where `crates/api` is the path to the Rust crate. This means there is a
   * `Cargo.toml` file in `crates/api`, and the main() function handles the lambda.

       *
       * @example
       *
       * To serve your function **from a path**, you'll need to configure the root domain

       *
       * ```ts title="sst.config.ts" {3,4}
       * const router = new sst.aws.Router("Router", {

 * The `Function` component lets you add serverless functions to your app.
 * It uses [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/).
 *
 * #### Supported runtimes
 *
 * Currently supports **Node.js** and **Golang** functions. **Python** and **Rust**
 * are community supported. Other runtimes are on the roadmap.
 *
 * @example
 *
 * #### Minimal example
 *
 *
 * <Tabs>
 *   <TabItem label="Node">
 *   Pass in the path to your handler function.
 *
 *   ```ts title="sst.config.ts"
 *   new sst.aws.Function("MyFunction", {
 *     handler: "src/lambda.handler"
 *   });
 *   ```
 *
 *   [Learn more below](#handler).
 *   </TabItem>
 *   <TabItem label="Python">
 *   Pass in the path to your handler function.
 *
 *   ```ts title="sst.config.ts"
 *   new sst.aws.Function("MyFunction", {
 *     runtime: "python3.11",
 *     handler: "functions/src/functions/api.handler"
 *   });
 *   ```
 *
 *   You need to have uv installed and your handler function needs to be in a uv workspace. [Learn more below](#handler).
 *   </TabItem>
 *   <TabItem label="Go">
 *   Pass in the directory to your Go module.
 *
 *   ```ts title="sst.config.ts"
 *   new sst.aws.Function("MyFunction", {
 *     runtime: "go",
 *     handler: "./src"
 *   });
 *   ```
 *
 *   [Learn more below](#handler).
 *   </TabItem>
 *   <TabItem label="Rust">
 *   Pass in the directory where your Cargo.toml lives.
 *
 *   ```ts title="sst.config.ts"
 *   new sst.aws.Function("MyFunction", {
 *     runtime: "rust",
 *     handler: "./crates/api/"
 *   });
 *   ```
 *
 *   [Learn more below](#handler).
 *   </TabItem>
 * </Tabs>
 *
 * #### Set additional config
 *
 * Pass in additional Lambda config.
 *
 * ```ts {3,4} title="sst.config.ts"
 * new sst.aws.Function("MyFunction", {
 *   handler: "src/lambda.handler",
 *   timeout: "3 minutes",
 *   memory: "1024 MB"
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * #### Link resources
 *
 * [Link resources](/docs/linking/) to the function. This will grant permissions
 * to the resources and allow you to access it in your handler.
 *
 * ```ts {5} title="sst.config.ts"
 * const bucket = new sst.aws.Bucket("MyBucket");
 *
 * new sst.aws.Function("MyFunction", {
 *   handler: "src/lambda.handler",
 *   link: [bucket]
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * You can use the [SDK](/docs/reference/sdk/) to access the linked resources
 * in your handler.
 *
 * <Tabs>
 *   <TabItem label="Node">
 *   ```ts title="src/lambda.ts"
 *   import { Resource } from "sst";
 *
 *   console.log(Resource.MyBucket.name);
 *   ```
 *   </TabItem>
 *   <TabItem label="Python">
 *   ```ts title="functions/src/functions/api.py"
 *   from sst import Resource
 *
 *   def handler(event, context):
 *       print(Resource.MyBucket.name)
 *   ```
 *
 *   Where the `sst` package can be added to your `pyproject.toml`.
 *
 *   ```toml title="functions/pyproject.toml"
 *   [tool.uv.sources]
 *   sst = { git = "https://github.com/sst/sst.git", subdirectory = "sdk/python", branch = "dev" }
 *   ```
 *   </TabItem>
 *   <TabItem label="Go">
 *   ```go title="src/main.go"
 *   import (
 *     "github.com/sst/sst/v3/sdk/golang/resource"
 *   )
 *
 *   resource.Get("MyBucket", "name")
 *   ```
 *   </TabItem>
 *   <TabItem label="Rust">
 *   ```rust title="src/main.rs"
 *   use sst_sdk::Resource;
 *   #[derive(serde::Deserialize, Debug)]
 *   struct Bucket {
 *      name: String,
 *   }
 *
 *   let resource = Resource::init().unwrap();
 *   let Bucket { name } = resource.get("Bucket").unwrap();
 *   ```
 *   </TabItem>
 * </Tabs>
 *
 * #### Set environment variables
 *
 * Set environment variables that you can read in your function. For example, using
 * `process.env` in your Node.js functions.
 *
 * ```ts {4} title="sst.config.ts"
 * new sst.aws.Function("MyFunction", {
 *   handler: "src/lambda.handler",
 *   environment: {
 *     DEBUG: "true"
 *   }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * #### Enable function URLs
 *
 * Enable function URLs to invoke the function over HTTP.
 *
 * ```ts {3} title="sst.config.ts"
 * new sst.aws.Function("MyFunction", {
 *   handler: "src/lambda.handler",
 *   url: true
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * #### Bundling
 *
 * Customize how SST uses [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) to bundle your Node.js
 * functions with the `nodejs` property.
 *
 * ```ts title="sst.config.ts" {3-5}
 * new sst.aws.Function("MyFunction", {
 *   handler: "src/lambda.handler",
 *   nodejs: {
 *     install: ["pg"]
 *   }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Or override it entirely by passing in your own function `bundle`.
